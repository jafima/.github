# A Java based Agent Framework for Intelligent and Mobile Agents

## Overview

JAFIMA, a framework that supports the development of intelligent and mobile agents for various applications. JAFIMA defines agents as software entities that have autonomy, sociability, reactivity, proactivity, communication, collaboration, negotiation, and reasoning abilities. JAFIMA also provides a layered architecture for agent design, consisting of seven layers that handle different aspects of agent behavior. Furthermore, JAFIMA uses object-oriented design patterns to structure and document the agent systems, promoting standardization, reuse, and adaptability. The work on JAFIMA illustrates the use of examples of agent systems in different domains and shows how design patterns can improve their quality and manageability. JAFIMA is a comprehensive and flexible framework design that can facilitate the creation of intelligent and mobile agents for various purposes.
